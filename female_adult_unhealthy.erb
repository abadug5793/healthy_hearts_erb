		<h3>Limit your intake of fast food per week to only once per week. Whenever you do go out to eat, try to make sure to pick items off the menu that are the more healthier than others. Try to limit eating red meat because there is a lot of saturated fats in them. As a substitute, try eating more chicken or even beans to get enough protein. In addition, adults tend to have a slower metabolism which means that they need to make sure to have a more consistent healthy diet. </h3>

    <h3>Exercise is just as important as eating healthy. We suggest that you try to get in a small workout almost everyday, even if it’s just for 30 minutes, in order to maintain body performance and regularity. Exercise is very important in order to prevent various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.</h3>
