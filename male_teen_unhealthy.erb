		<h3>Limit your intake of fast food per week to only once per week. Whenever you do go out to eat, try to make sure to pick items off the menu that are the more healthier than others. Try to limit eating red meat because there is a lot of saturated fats in them. As a substitute, try eating more chicken or even beans to get enough protein.</h3>
